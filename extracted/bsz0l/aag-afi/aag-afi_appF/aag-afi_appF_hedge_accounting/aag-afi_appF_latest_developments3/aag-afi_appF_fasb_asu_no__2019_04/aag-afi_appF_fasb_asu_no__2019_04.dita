   <body class="- topic/body ">
      <p class="- topic/p ">In April 2019, FASB issued ASU No. 2019-04 to clarify, correct, and
                        improve various aspects of the guidance in ASU Nos. 2016-01, 2016-13, and
                        2017-12 related to financial instruments. The discussion herein will only
                        address those amendments related to ASU No. 2017-12. Amendments related to
                        ASU Nos. 2016-01 and ASU No. 2016-13 were addressed in previous sections of
                        this appendix.</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">ASU No. 2019-04 clarifies certain aspects of the amendments in ASU No.
                        2017-12 as follows:</p>
      <ul class="- topic/ul ">
         <li class="- topic/li ">

                                    rate risk.</i> The amendments clarify that an entity may
                                measure the change in fair value of a hedged item using an assumed
                                term only for changes attributable to interest rate risk. They also
                                clarify that an entity may measure the change in the fair value of
                                the hedged item attributable to interest rate risk using an assumed
                                term when the hedged item is designated in a hedge of both interest
                                rate risk and foreign exchange risk. In that instance, the change in
                                carrying value of the hedged item attributable to foreign exchange
                                risk must continue to be measured based on changes in the spot
                                exchange rate in accordance with FASB ASC 815-25-35-18. In addition,
                                the amendments clarify that one or more separately designated
                                partial-term fair value hedging relationships of a single financial
                                instrument can be outstanding at the same time, and for
                                forward-starting partial-term fair value hedges, the issuance of the
                                hedged item is assumed to occur on the date in which the first
                                hedged cash flow begins to accrue.</p>

                                basis adjustment before the fair value hedging relationship is
                                discontinued. If an entity elects to amortize the basis adjustment
                                during an outstanding partial-term hedge, that basis adjustment
                                should be fully amortized by the hedged itemâ€™s assumed maturity date
                                in accordance with FASB ASC 815-25-35-13B.</p>
